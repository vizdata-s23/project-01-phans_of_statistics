Each country submits a song that is to be performed live to a centralized committee that plays the song over a common broadcast, and each country then votes on the other countries' songs. The competition began in 1956, and has occurred every year with the exception of 2020 due to the COVID pandemic. As of 2022, at least 52 countries have participated at least once, with Ireland being the recipient of the most winners. The competition has cemented itself as a periodic staple for each country to present a culturally significant piece on an international stage, and its influence has spread outside of Europe in recent years.\n\nThe dataset, contained within eurovision.csv, consists of every song performed in Eurovision history, from 1956 to 2022. This data was collected from the [Eurovision Song Contest website](https://eurovision.tv/), and was found as a [TidyTuesday dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-05-17/readme.md) on GitHub. The dataset consists of 2005 observations and 18 variables, with each observation being a different song entered for the competition. The main variables used in this visual analysis are `year` (year of competition), `host_country` (where the competition was held), `artist_country` (the country the artist represented), `running_order` (the order in which the song was performed), `total_points` (total points earned in the competition), `rank` (rank of the song in the competition), and `winner` (a binary variable indicating whether the song won or didn't win the competition).\n\n## Question 1: Home Country Advantage\n\n### Introduction\n\nOur first question asks if contestants from the `host_country` in each competition tend to perform better than foreign contestants. We were interested in this question because hosting a competition at home is often seen as advantageous, especially in sports such as basketball and soccer where having a supportive crowd boosts team energy (and on the flip side unnerves opponents) and playing in a familiar environment helps players feel comfortable (plus not having to travel). Consequently, we wanted to see if there was a similar pattern for singing competitions like Eurovision, and if there was, to what extent it correlates with performance.\n\nTo conduct our analysis, we used the variables `total_points`, `rank`, and `year`. We also created a new binary variable called `from_host_country` for each observation that indicates whether the contestant was competing in their home country (done by matching the `host_country` and `artist_country` variables and returning \"true\" if a match, and \"false\" if not).\n\n### Approach\n\nWe used our first plot as a histogram of `total_points` or final `rank` of host country participants faceted by decade to look at whether home country advantage was more prevalent in certain eras than others. A ridge plot could also be used here, which we will decide upon visualization when we can compare to values of both. Furthermore, we can use `total_points` or `rank` for each contestant as a measure of success and compare the distributions of these metrics between host country participants and non-host country participants in our second plot through a histogram faceted by whether `from_host_country`. A violin plot can also be used here for the second plot to make comparisons better, but we will again decide which to use upon visualization.\n\n### Analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/q1 data wrangling-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 66 × 3\n# Groups:   year [66]\n    year era           n\n   <dbl> <chr>     <int>\n 1  2008 2000-2010    63\n 2  2011 2011-2022    63\n 3  2018 2011-2022    63\n 4  2009 2000-2010    62\n 5  2012 2011-2022    62\n 6  2016 2011-2022    62\n 7  2017 2011-2022    62\n 8  2019 2011-2022    61\n 9  2015 2011-2022    60\n10  2022 2011-2022    60\n# … with 56 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1,272 × 4\n# Groups:   year [66]\n    year from_host_country  rank     n\n   <dbl> <chr>             <dbl> <int>\n 1  1956 No                    2    12\n 2  1962 No                   13     4\n 3  1963 No                   13     4\n 4  1964 No                   13     4\n 5  1965 No                   15     4\n 6  1974 No                   14     4\n 7  2007 No                   22     4\n 8  1961 No                   10     3\n 9  1962 No                   10     3\n10  1967 No                    8     3\n# … with 1,262 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/q1 first plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/q1 second plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/q1 second plot-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/q1 second plot-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/q1 second plot-4.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/q1 second plot-5.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Discussion\n\n(1-3 paragraphs): In the Discussion section, interpret the results of your analysis. Identify any trends revealed (or not revealed) by the plots. Speculate about why the data looks the way it does.\n\n## Question 2: Performance Order and Success\n\n### Introduction\n\nIntroduction (1-2 paragraphs): Introduction to the question and what parts of the dataset are necessary to answer the question. Also discuss why you're interested in this question.\n\nWe are interested in this question because we wanted to see if voters were biased towards certain performances based on their performance order. In these types of competitions, there is always fear of lack of voter consistency due to recency bias or boredom as performances continue throughout the competition. By observing if there are significant trends in how voters vote by performance order, we can gain a better understanding of these biases and how they affect the success of contestants.\n\n### Approach\n\nThe first plot we use to answer this question is a group of boxplots comparing the adjusted percentages of points earned described in the first question (`total_points_pct`) by the appearance time of the song, defined as being in the first third (\"beginning\") , second third (\"middle\"), or last third (\"end\") of the performance by running order (`running_order_group`). These boxplots are then faceted by the `era` in which the competition occurred. A boxplot was chosen because it is easy to see inter-group statistics (such as percentiles) better, which makes comparing the general trends of total point percentage evident in the three different appearance groups more plausible. Furthermore, outliers for each of these groups are easily identifiable, and seeing which groups have more extreme outliers is possible with these boxplots. Finally, they are faceted by era because we wanted to observe temporal trends in total points percentage for the three appearance groups.\n\n### Analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/q2 first plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/q2-second-plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Discussion\n\nFrom our second graph, we see consistent results with the first one. For first, second, and third place finishers, we see an almost identical trend-line: a slight positive relationship between year and running order, suggesting that the top three finishers in Eurovision generally performed slightly later in the order than their predecessors from the previous years. Also, there is not a significant difference between the running order of first, second, and third place finishers. However, overall, the lines are so volatile that it suggests that running order is not a very strong factor in performance.\n\nCombining the results from the graph, we conclude that performing later in the running order is correlated slightly with better performance, which could be explained by the fact that people may remember the songs performed towards the end more as they are the most recent in their memory when they vote. The trend that this has more of an impact in recent years could be explained by the fact that Eurovision has expanded over the years, meaning more performers, which would make it harder to remember the earlier performers during voting. Finally, the fact that the running orders of the top three finishers are not too different from each other despite the above results could be explained by the fact that running order matters more for distinguishing the above average from the rest but less for the best of the best.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-05-17/readme.md\n",
